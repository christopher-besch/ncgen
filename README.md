# ncgen
A very badly written experiment in generating code in C++. PLEASE DON'T LOOK AT IT ITS TERRIBLE

## What ?
So essentially all this does is take a text file structured in an intermediary format and translates it into the desired language.

## Why ?
Why not ?

## What about Linux ?
I have written this in Visual Studio 2019 on Windows. Since I don't intend to this ever be used by literally anyone, you can try to compile it on any platform. I am using C++ 17 with the STD filesystem, so if that works on your platform you should be able to compile this - but try for yourself. If anyone wants to put this in a build system feel free to.

## The intermediary language
Ill write this as soon as I can. In the meantime take a look at the example - it uses pretty much everything available right now.
